5.27.25
    Built inital functionality. Using nunchuk controller over I2C and RFM69HCW packet radio for comms.
    Packet format currently is primitive, transmitted in JSON that has been dumped into raw bytearrays.
    No integrity checks, only node ID is appended to packet to indicate source of packet.
    Slicing may be necessary if larger data sets are required, or optimization of packet size.
    Trying to avoid slicing to eliminate sensitivity to packet loss.
    Heartbeat packet system still needing to be built to kick watchdog on robot.
    Possibly condsidering adding LCD/OLED terminal display or serial link to logger for better debug. (Sparkfun OpenLog?)
